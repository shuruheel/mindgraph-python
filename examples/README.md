# MindGraph Python SDK — Examples

## research_continuity.py

**What it demonstrates:** An AI research agent that evaluates vector databases across two sessions, using MindGraph as persistent structured memory. Session 2 retrieves goals, open questions, and findings from Session 1 — then uses that context to drive new observations and a final decision.

**Why it matters:** Without structured memory, an agent resuming a task would re-research everything from scratch. With MindGraph, the agent picks up exactly where it left off: it knows what questions are still open, what claims have been established, and what the original goal was. Retrieved context directly shapes Session 2 behavior — open questions become targeted follow-up research, prior claims inform the final recommendation.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `pip install mindgraph-sdk`
- A MindGraph API key ([get one here](https://mindgraph.cloud))

### Run

```bash
export MINDGRAPH_URL="https://api.mindgraph.cloud"
export MINDGRAPH_API_KEY="mg_..."
python examples/research_continuity.py
```

### What to look for

1. **Resume context block** (Session 2) — the agent prints retrieved goals, open questions, and prior findings before doing anything new.
2. **Retrieval drives behavior** — each open question from Session 1 gets a targeted new observation in Session 2. The decision summary references the original goal. The distill summary synthesizes findings from both sessions.
3. **Structured knowledge** — sources, observations, claims with evidence, open questions, decisions with options, and a final distillation. Each node type carries semantic meaning the agent can query later.

### SDK methods used

| Layer | Methods |
|-------|---------|
| Reality | `capture(action="source")`, `capture(action="observation")` |
| Epistemic | `argue(claim=, evidence=)`, `inquire(action="open_question")` |
| Intent | `commit(action="goal")`, `deliberate(open_decision / add_option / resolve)` |
| Memory | `session(open / close)`, `journal()`, `distill()` |
| Cross-cutting | `retrieve(active_goals / open_questions)`, `search()` |
